# Heart Disease Prediction

This repository contains a Python script for predicting heart disease using machine learning models. The dataset used in this project is available in the 'heart.csv' file.

## Project Overview

The main goals of this project are as follows:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Understanding the dataset through visualizations and statistical analysis.
2. **Model Comparison:** Evaluating and comparing the performance of different machine learning models.
3. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Fine-tuning the hyperparameters of selected models.
4. **Model Evaluation:** Displaying metrics such as confusion matrix, classification report, and ROC curve.
5. **Cross-validation:** Assessing model performance through cross-validation.

## Learning Outcomes

By exploring this project, you will gain hands-on experience in:

- Exploring and visualizing a dataset to understand its characteristics.
- Implementing and comparing machine learning models using scikit-learn.
- Tuning hyperparameters to improve model performance.
- Evaluating model performance through various metrics, including precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Using cross-validation to assess the robustness of machine learning models.

## Dependencies

Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`

You can install these dependencies using the following command: pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

## Usage
Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/heart-disease-prediction.git
Navigate to the project directory: cd heart-disease-prediction
Run the script: main.py

## Example Output
The script generates visualizations and outputs relevant information about the dataset and model performance. Here is an example of expected output:

- Visualization of the dataset distribution.
- Model comparison bar plot showing accuracy scores.
- Hyperparameter tuning results for Logistic Regression and Random Forest.
- Confusion matrix heatmap for the selected model.
- Classification report providing precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Cross-validation bar plot comparing accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
